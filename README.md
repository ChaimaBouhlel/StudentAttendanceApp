# Student Attendance App

## Overview
This Git repository contains the code for a simple Android application that demonstrates the use of adapters and AdapterView to display student attendance in various courses. The application allows users to search for a student by their name or first name.

## Features
- Display student attendance for multiple courses.
- Search for a student by name or first name.
- User-friendly interface with the use of adapters for data presentation.
- **RecyclerView for Dynamic Data Presentation:** Utilizes the `RecyclerView` widget for efficient and dynamic data presentation. The use of `RecyclerView` allows for smooth scrolling and optimized memory usage, making it ideal for displaying lists of data.
- **AdapterView for Data Binding:** Implements `AdapterView` in conjunction with custom adapters to bind data from a data source (such as an array or cursor) to the UI elements in the application. This bridge between data and UI ensures a seamless and organized display of student attendance information.
- **Display Student Attendance for Multiple Courses:** The application employs the power of `RecyclerView` to present student attendance records for multiple courses in a structured and user-friendly manner.
